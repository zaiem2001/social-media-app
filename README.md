## To run this project in your pc :-
 * git clone **https://github.com/zaiem2001/social-media-app/**
 * in **root folder** i.e Not in client or backend folder
 * npm install
 * npm run both
 * image upload will not work on your local pc as my **firebase api keys** are used in this project which are not committed to the github.
 * You can use locally by adding your api keys and app id in **./client/src/firebase** folder where **firebase config** has all **api** keys, replace mine with your creds
 * enjoy üòÅ
